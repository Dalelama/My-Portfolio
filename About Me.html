        <p class="bio">My name is Dale Lama. The journey of my life begins from a small remote village Helambu, approximately 50 miles north-east from the capital city Kathmandu, Nepal where I was born and raised. Pure water, clean air and breath taking mountainous landscape of majestic nature of this place have been able to attract thousands of tourists every year from all over the world. Seeing different people from different culture and language, I learnt exploring some thing new all the time. In 1997, I moved to the United States. Everything altogether was a whole new world for me. I did not have any work experience of this fast paced environment and I had to struggle a lot just to keep up with the living. I did not have a clear direction of my destination, all I had was an idea of seeking better brought me here and will guide me further. I kept waiting for my turn in the land that is known for opportunities, following the same routine everyday like a robot. One thing was certain that I have to get out of it. Then, I was by myself, and as we know the circumstances in our life do not always go the way we plan. It took really long. But, hey now I have my family here with me and most importantly I have found the right track of education. I currently study at LaGuardia Community College, majoring in New Media Technology. Keeping up with my work, giving time to kids, helping them with their home-work, following up with school meetings and medical appointments, taking care of the family, managing house and yet maintaining my study. So, in the beginning it was a kind of crazy to struggle with everything in my way, but later I learned to plan things. I learned to draw a clear map of tasks that I was going to be doing throughout the course and things got smoother. My future educational goals include transferring to a four-year college to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Digital Media. I have looked into Queens College, Brooklyn Technology college, and John Jay College. My experience at LaGuardia Community College has been wonderful so far. All the courses that I have been taking every semester have given me the confidence to be myself and show my creative side that I thought it was gone. I also enjoy live performances such as theater, concerts, and comedy shows. These art forms give vivid emotions and unforgettable experiences. I used to perform in stand-up comedy and shows in community gatherings. I know how it feels from both inside and outside which gives me an ability to look at situations from different perspectives and choose the best solution. Planning, organizing and overlooking strategies are among my strengths. I enjoy setting up goals and accomplishing them no matter how challenging they are. I consider myself an ambitious, determined, and well-organized person. I am a hardworking individual looking to find a niche in the New Media field. I still have a long way to go but this is just the beginning of a bright and better future, I enjoy learning more about my passion and the best thing is to find the creative side. I am going to put my whole effort, work hard, fight the good fight and get my college degree so that I find a decent job that generate a residual income and make my life financially secured for the rest of my life.</p>
